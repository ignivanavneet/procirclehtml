                </div>
                <div class="card-body-block">
                    <p class="medium">This trait is characterised be a person’s openness to experiences. An open person tends to be more creative, more intellectually curious and more open to emotion.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A High score indicates a candidate that wants to experience different things in life. They tend to be very imaginative and therefore demonstrate creative and artistic abilities and have a variety of interests. They can find routines and system rules restrictive and drive change by taking risks. They take a more creative, unconventional approach to solving problems.</p>
                    <p class="medium">An Average score indicates a candidate who may on occasion like adventure and new experiences but they like to feel stable through routine and structure. Although they can conform to rules and regulations, they are not afraid to disagree with the rules from time to time and come up with their own ideas.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A Low score indicates a candidate who is practical and conventional and more suited to a conservative environment. They want security and stability and are able to follow rules and procedures. They keep their head out of the clouds, avoiding the unknown and are consequently risk averse and will adapt what they know rather than creating new approaches. </p>
                    <p class="medium">An employer should select depending on the working environment. Low scorers would be more suited to traditional, corporate environments, with a set job description, in middle management roles. High scorers would suit a more creative environment such as a start-up or creative company, and a role with lots of variety.</p>

                    <h5 class="medium h5">Conscientiousness</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="card-body-block">
                    <p class="medium">This trait is characterised by a person’s thoroughness. Conscientious people are able to follow instruction, complete their tasks, meet deadlines and show a good work ethic. </p>
                    <p class="medium">A High score indicates a candidate who shows a structured approach to work and is detail oriented. They tend to perform very well at work and want to see a job through to completion. They prefer planning over spontaneity. They are determined, and are able to control their impulses for the sake of long-term achievement.</p>
                    <p class="medium">An Average score indicates a candidate who is motivated, with career oriented goals and ambition for success. They often try their best in their work. They occasionally do act on impulse and don’t think things through, however they are cautious for the most part.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A Low score indicates a candidate who may work well in an unstructured or chaotic environment. Rather than focusing on the detail, they like the strategic ‘big picture’ approach. Whilst their leaning towards impulsiveness allows them to make direct and snap decisions, it can lead to carelessness and failure to comply with the rules.</p>
                    <p class="medium">An employer would usually want a conscientious, detail oriented candidate who is willing to work hard. Therefore, it may be sensible to choose an average to high scoring candidate.</p>

                    <h5 class="medium h5">Extroversion</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="card-body-block">
                    <p class="medium">This trait is characterised by a person’s ability to engage with their social surroundings. Extroverts enjoy interacting with people and are perceived as high energy.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A High score indicates a social candidate who enjoys the company of other people. They tend to be dynamic, outgoing and active and seek out social interaction. Their motivation and enthusiasm are likely to benefit most companies. However, be aware that they enjoy a fast pace and variety at work, which means they can become bored with routine tasks. </p>
                    <p class="medium">An Average score indicates that a candidate may be reserved at times but they are approachable when necessary. They tend to be happy working by themselves or with other people. They are less likely to become bored with routine.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A Low score means that a candidate is probably reserved and likes to remain independent. They tend to be quieter and less involved in the social world. They are more suited to a calm, heads down environment and they are more likely to be able to concentrate on a long, routine task.</p>
                    <p class="medium">An employer would usually want a balance. You want someone who will be able to maintain focus and discipline when necessary even if they are not being stimulated. Again, the desired score should be dependent on the working environment and role. A very routine role may need someone lower on the extroversion scale. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="card-body-block">
                    <p class="medium">This trait is characterised by a candidate’s engagement in social harmony and their interaction with those around them.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A High score means that a candidate is empathetic, co-operative and loves helping other people. They have a very optimistic view of human nature and are patient with other people. They can however be seen as too soft and submissive and therefore not be suitable for a more aggressive working environment.</p>
                    <p class="medium">An Average score means that a candidate may overall be a sympathetic person who gets along with most people. They probably follow the rules, get along with people and tend to take instruction well. However, they are able to demonstrate independent thinking when required and disagree if necessary.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A low score suggests means that a candidate may be dominant rather than cooperative in a team situation. They are tough and determined to meet their goals, which may make them impatient and hostile to other colleagues. They place self-interest above getting along with others. </p>
                    <p class="medium">An employer would usually want a balance between being too agreeable and being able to disagree when necessary. An average to high score. However, an employer should choose depending on the working environment – a high scorer would probably not be suitable for a tough working environment.</p>

                    <p class="medium">This trait is characterised by negative feelings and emotions of people and how they tend to cope.</p>
                    <p class="medium">A High score means that a candidate tends to be emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist, which means that they often tend to be in a bad mood.</p>
                    <p class="medium">An Average score means that a candidate can sometimes get periods of ‘feeling blue’ or being emotional but that they cope with these episodes well. They show emotion when required but also know when to stay quiet and not let it interfere with their work. </p>
                    <p class="medium">A Low score means that a candidate is emotionally secure, calm and stable. Whilst this is an advantage, too low a score, could make them ‘machine like’ and unresponsive.</p>
                    <p class="medium">Employers should seek a low to moderate neurotic state to maintain a stable and adjusted working environment. </p>
